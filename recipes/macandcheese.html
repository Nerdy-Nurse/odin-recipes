        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package of elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flower</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp dried thyme</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp white pepper</li>
            <li>3 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>3 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese, divided</li>
            <li>1 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1/2 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 tbsp butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the macaroni, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is cooked through but still slightly firm, about 8 minutes. Drain well.</li>
            <li>Melt 1/4 cup butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. When the butter starts to foam and bubble, stir in the flour; cook on medium heat until flour just begins to turn pale yellow, 3 to 4 minutes. Add thyme, cayenne pepper, and white pepper; cook and stir another minute, then whisk in 1 cup of milk until smooth. Pour in remaining milk and whisk again. Bring the sauce just to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Stir in nutmeg, Worcestershire sauce, and salt; simmer on medium-low heat until thickened, about 8 minutes, whisking often. Turn heat off, then add 2 1/4 cups of Cheddar cheese; stir until melted and combined. Add Dijon mustard.</li>
            <li>Transfer the macaroni into a casserole dish, then pour in the cheese sauce; stir to thoroughly combine sauce with pasta. Mix panko bread crumbs and 1 tablespoon melted butter in a small bowl, and sprinkle crumbs on top of macaroni and cheese. Sprinkle remaining 3/4 cup of Cheddar cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bread crumbs and Cheddar cheese topping are golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
